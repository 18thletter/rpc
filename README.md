# Corsac RPC

API server library inspired by Dart's `rpc` package.

This library is built on top of standard `HttpServer` from `dart:io` leveraging
some Corsac components like
[corsac_kernel](https://github.com/corsac-dart/kernel),
[corsac_router](https://github.com/corsac-dart/router) and
[corsac_middleware](https://github.com/corsac-dart/middleware).

# Status

This library is a work-in-progress so breaking changes may occur without notice.

Documentation to be added.
